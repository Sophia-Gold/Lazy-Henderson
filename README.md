# Lazy-Henderson.cljs
Inspired by [Peter Henderson](http://pmh-systems.co.uk/pmhs/)'s seminal papers on Functional Geometry in [Higher Order and Symbolic Computation, Vol 15, 2002](http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/ph/papers/funcgeo2.pdf) and [LFP '82 Proceedings of the 1982 ACM symposium on LISP and functional programming, 1982](http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/ph/funcgeo.pdf). Bugs ironed out as well as integration with [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and more coming soon.
