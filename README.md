# Lazy-Henderson.cljs
Inspired by [Peter Henderson](http://pmh-systems.co.uk/pmhs/)'s seminal papers on Functional Geometry in [Higher Order and Symbolic Computation, Vol 15, 2002](http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/ph/papers/funcgeo2.pdf) and [LFP '82 Proceedings of the 1982 ACM symposium on LISP and functional programming, 1982](http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/ph/funcgeo.pdf).

The basic version uses the stick figure of "George," the eponymous low-level programmer of abstractions big and small from SICP volume one, coordinates provided by the now defunct numerical programming blog of astrophysicist [Weiqun Zhang](https://ccse.lbl.gov/people/weiqun/):

George on a recursive mindtrip from having to actually implement all of Abelson & Sussman's code on a hardware level:
